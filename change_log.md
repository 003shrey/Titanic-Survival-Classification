Repo Created - 23 dec 2025

24 dec 2025- Classification algorithm is applied on the titanic survivial dataset to get to know the person survived or not, different model is applied and their accuracy score is computed, all of this done in 4 hours of continous model implementation and evaluation

May reopen this repo for any futher model implementation to check if that Algo is better than the exsisting one, I think next I will use Random forest on the dataset
